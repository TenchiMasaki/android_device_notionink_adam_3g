HOW-TO use patch system:

1. Make changes to a git (frameworks/av,bionic,etc)
2. Do git diff > dir_dir-patchname.diff (for example if in frameworks/av you should use frameworks_av-testpatch.diff)
3. Move .diff file to patches in device tree
4. Once vendorsetup.sh is executed it checks if frameworks_av-testpatch.p file exists in root of Android build and if not applies patch to the repo in the name of the patch
