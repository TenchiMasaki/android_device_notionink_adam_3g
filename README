Here's Adam 3G device tree for android Candy-M.

Make sure you have adam_common tree downloaded

Copy to android/device/notionink/adam_3g/

run extract-files.sh or copy-files.sh that'll create your vendor directory

go back to source root

Shell Type: ". build/envsetup.sh"

Let it finish.

Shell Type: "lunch aosp_adam_3g-userdebug"

Wait for it to get done.

Then type: "time make -j16" (replace 16 with whatever your machine can handle.)
