Here's Adam 3G device tree for android KatKiss 4.4.

Make sure you have adam_common tree downloaded

Copy to android/device/notionink/adam_3g/

run extract-files.sh or copy-files.sh that'll create your vendor directory

Set these environment variables, modifying KKGCC to correct path:
export KKGCC=/root/katkiss4.4/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86
export PATH=$KKGCC/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/bin:$PATH
export ARM_EABI_TOOLCHAIN=$KKGCC/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/bin
export ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN=/$KKGCC/x86/i686-linux-android-4.6/bin
export ARCH=arm
export SUBARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-

go back to source root

Shell Type: ". build/envsetup.sh"

Let it finish.

Shell Type: "lunch kk_adam_3g-userdebug"

Wait for it to get done.

Then type: "time make -j16" (replace 16 with whatever your machine can handle.)
